# Accounting Ledger Application

## Description: 
The Financial Transactions Management System is a Java-based application designed to help users track their financial transactions, 
including deposits and payments. Users can easily input transaction details, view their transaction ledger, and generate reports 
based on specific criteria such as date and vendor. The application can load and save transactions using a CSV file, which keeps 
the data saved for future use.

## Features
Add Deposits and Payments: Users can add new financial transactions, which are stored in a CSV file.
View Ledger: Users can view all transactions, only deposits, or only negative transactions.
Reporting: Generate reports for specific time periods (month-to-date, previous month, etc.) and search by vendor.
